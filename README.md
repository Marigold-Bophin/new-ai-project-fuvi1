# InjuryPredictor: AI-based Sports Injury Prevention

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

InjuryPredictor is an AI-based system that predicts the likelihood of sports injuries based on training data and personal health profiles. By analyzing historical injury records, training intensity, and biomechanical factors, the system provides recommendations for injury prevention.

## Background

Sports injuries can significantly impact athletes' careers and health. Predicting and preventing injuries can help athletes optimize their training and avoid long-term damage.

* High-intensity training often leads to injuries.
* Many injuries could be prevented with early intervention.
* Lack of personalized risk analysis in current prevention strategies.

As a sports enthusiast and AI researcher, I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to enhance sports performance and health.

## How is it used?

Athletes and their coaches input training data, health parameters, and past injuries into the system. The AI model analyzes this data and provides a risk assessment along with personalized recommendations.

1. Athlete logs training data (e.g., intensity, duration).
2. AI processes biomechanical and health data.
3. Model predicts the risk of injury.
4. Athlete receives recommendations for injury prevention.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data is gathered from:
* Open sports injury databases.
* Wearable fitness tracker APIs.
* Medical studies on injury prevention.

Methods:
* **Machine Learning** – Supervised classification models.
* **Neural Networks** – For complex pattern detection.
* **Data Augmentation** – To improve training data quality.

| AI Method       | Use Case |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Random Forest | Injury classification |
| Neural Networks | Injury pattern analysis |
| Logistic Regression | Probability estimation |

## Challenges

* The accuracy of predictions depends on data quality.
* Ethical concerns regarding personal health data privacy.
* AI cannot replace medical diagnosis—only assist in prevention.

## What next?

* Integration with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness bands).
* More sports-specific models (e.g., soccer, running, weightlifting).
* Collaboration with sports organizations for real-world validation.
